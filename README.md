## Mockup Details

You have to design a website similar to the mockup provided. Scroll down the page to see the mockup image of the website.

## Instructions and steps to design the website

You are provided with the steps below, carefully observe each step and start building the documentation page.

##### Step #1: 
> There should be a *main* element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page’s main content (technical documentation).

##### Step #2:  
> Within the #main-doc element, there should be several *section* elements, each with a class of *main-section*. There should be a minimum of 5 sections.

##### Step #3:  
> The first element within each .main-section should be a *header element* which should have text that describes the topic of that section.

##### Step #4: 
> Each section element with the class of *main-section* should also have an *id* that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. All spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").

##### Step #5:  
> The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).

##### Step #6: 
> The *.main-section* elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

##### Step #7: 
> The *.main-section* elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

##### Step #8: 
> There should be a nav element with a corresponding *id="navbar"*. 

##### Step #9: 
> The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

##### Step #10: 
> Additionally, the navbar should contain a link element with a class of *nav-link*. There should be one for every element with the class *main-section*.

##### Step #11: 
> The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

##### Step #12: 
> Each element with the class of *nav-link* should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a “Hello world” section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text “Hello world”).

##### Step #13: 
> When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g If you click on a nav-link element that contains the text “Hello world”, the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

###### GOOD LUCK!
